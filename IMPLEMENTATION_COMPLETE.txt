Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the asset tracking workflow with a dedicated Downpayment section.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. New Component: DownpaymentTable.jsx
Created src/components/DownpaymentTable.jsx with:
- "Add Downpayment" button - Allows accountants to add new assets with downpayment
- Search functionality - Filter downpayment assets by name, tag, or category
- Payment progress display - Visual progress bar showing payment completion percentage
- Description field - Text area for downpayment/partial payment descriptions
- Edit functionality - Update payment amounts and descriptions
- Delete functionality - Remove downpayment records

### 2. Dashboard Integration
- Added "Downpayment" navigation tab in the sidebar
- Separate view for downpayment/partial payment assets

### 3. Auto-Transfer Logic
- When payment completion reaches exactly 100%, asset automatically changes status from "Pending" to "Active"
- Transfers the item to the official Asset Inventory section

### 4. Database Requirement
Add these columns to Supabase assets table:
- downpayment_amount (numeric, default: 0)
- downpayment_description (text)

### Features:
- Separate "Downpayment" tab/button in navigation
- Add asset with downpayment amount and description
- View payment progress status with visual progress bar
- Edit payment amounts and descriptions
- Automatic transfer to Asset Inventory when 100% paid
- Search and filter downpayment assets
